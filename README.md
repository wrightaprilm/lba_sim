lba_sim
=======

short simulation pipe for simulating effects of lba
 
All scripts for generating nucleotdie sequences via Seq-gen, compiling data files for use with MrBayes, running Mr.Bayes and processing & plotting data

Seq_pip.sh generates the datasets. Capper.sh adds the appropriate capper to the datasets. No_para.sh strips taxa appropriately to simulate incomplete taxon sampling. h_test*.py tests for the frequency of specified clades (Nepomorpha as monophyletic versus not).
